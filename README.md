Getting Started
Before using the API, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager)
MongoDB 


These are the packages currently required for the project:

Backend (Node.js Express API):  

express: Web framework for Node.js.  
jsonwebtoken: For handling JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.  
mongoose: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.  
cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.  
express-validator (or express-validation as mentioned in your package.json): For request validation in Express.  
bcrypt and bcryptjs: Libraries for password hashing.  
dotenv: For loading environment variables from a .env file.  

Frontend (React Web App):  

axios: For making HTTP requests from the frontend.   
react: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.   
react-dom: React DOM library for rendering React components.   
react-router-dom: React router library for handling client-side routing.   
firebase: Firebase JavaScript SDK for integrating Firebase services.   

Configuration
You need to configure the API by setting your JWT secret key in the verifyToken middleware and configuring your MongoDB connection in the mongoose.connect() method.
// Replace 'your_jwt_secret_key' with your actual JWT secret key
const jwtSecretKey = 'your_jwt_secret_key';

// Configure your MongoDB connection here
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});
